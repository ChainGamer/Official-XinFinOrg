                            <h3>● The Problem XinFin is solving</h3>
                            <div>
                                <p>Demand for infrastructure and other government services is rising and many countries are faced with the challenge of delivering increased investment in an era of reduced fiscal capacity. This is forcing governments to focus on prioritizing their infrastructure investments in favour of projects that can deliver increased economic growth and social benefit.</p>
                                <p>Infrastructure prioritization is often an informal process and there is no standard process or approach at either the state or the central government level. This prioritization leads to delays and implementation of projects that may not necessarily drive the economic growth. The current global infrastructure deficit is estimated to be $5 trillion and governments & institutions around the world are struggling to get financing for their infrastructure boost.</p>
                                <p>In today's world of high demand for infrastructure, slow economic growth and constrained fiscal budgets, we believe that governments, infrastructure investors and project owners,and sponsors must rethink the financing model they choose for infrastructure investments. XinFin has leveraged the power of blockchain technology as a tool to create the next generation of money and finance. We have created an efficient solution between the institutions, governments and global suppliers that like a finance mechanism. This finance mechanism is called as XDC token. The platform runs the XDC tokens on a private permissioned blockchain to enable global real-time trade and financing. Thus, we plan on using this platform as a much-needed bridge to overcome infrastructure deficit.</p>

                            <h3>● What is Hybrid blockchain?</h3>
                            <div>
                                <p>XinFin has developed a highly scalable, secure, permissioned and commercial grade Blockchain architecture that combines the best features of Bitcoin, Quorum and Ethereum. It's a combination of permissioned and public chain that addresses scalability and security. The Proof of Authority eventually leads to Proof of Stake. XinFin blockchain is powered by XDC01 protocol, underlying XDC tokens can be used for real time payment and settlement.</p>
                                <p>The XDC Blockchain is built upon the paradigm of consortium Blockchains. The architecture differs from conventional private/permissioned Blockchains as well as public Blockchains. Built upon the Ethereum codebase, the XDC Blockchain also deals with the system state rather than blocks of transactions.</p>
                                <p>There are two different kinds of networks that can exist within the XDC ecosystem. Firstly, the public network that all constituents are part of and a private/permissioned network that restricts participation. And secondly, the private network state is maintained in its respective network but a record (hash) of transactions and smart contracts is stored on the public state of the Blockchain.</p>
                                <p>The public state of the XDC Blockchain is shared by all participating nodes that are owned by different kinds of constituents. Groups of nodes can further form fully permissioned networks with their own private state that is accessible only to authorized members. For instance, let us assume that a private marketplace for goods and services is set up in Network 1. The specifics of the trade between parties are not accessible to Network 2. But, the record of individual trades is stored as hashes on the public state that is shared by all such that even in the private network there is an immutable record of transactions.</p>
                            </div>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <h3>● Is Hybrid Blockchain based on POW or POS?</h3>
                            <div>
                                <p>The XDC hybrid blockchain does not have Proof of Work. Our consensus architecture is similar to Proof of Authority. Groups of trusted but distributed nodes take part in the consensus mechanism. There are stake requirements for these nodes to participate in the process. These stake requirements guarantee the correctness and agreement of the network as a whole.</p>
                            </div>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <h3>● How many transactions are you looking at optimally? Horizontal side chains?</h3>
                            <div>
                                <p>Since, the core consensus process of the XDC protocol is architecturally similar to Proof of Authority, while deriving the benefits of proof of stake; it does not use the expensive and energy heavy proof of work. This not just ensures that the network is a "green network" but is also able to process anywhere from 150 to 300 transactions per second. Our in-house R&D team is working on throughput improvements in both the public and private networks of the XDC blockchain.</p>
                            </div>

                            <h3>● How can institutions participate?</h3>
                            <div>
                                <p>Hybrid architecture of the XDC protocol allows institutions to build their projects over the permissioned sub-network connected to XDC protocol. The institutions can choose to work with a fully permissioned instance allowing full security of sensitive financial data, work with XDC protocol as a messaging layer or connect to the various digital asset liquidity mediums through the XDC protocol.</p>
                            </div>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <h3>● What is the consensus architecture for XDC Blockchain?</h3>
                            <div>
                                <p>The consensus architecture for the XDC protocol is divided into two parts. The first is the XDC consortium membership requirements. In order to participate in the XDC network, institutions must belong to one of the three tiers. The tiers, in part, correspond to the XDC token holdings. Any fraudulent activity results in seizure of the XDC tokens that are staked to gain membership and host network infrastructure.</p>
                                <p>The second is the actual process of achieving consensus. Once the network topology is stable, nodes come together to vote on transactions that can be put on a new block. Then a new leader is selected from among the validator nodes at random. This leader creates a new block with the transactions that have been voted on by the other full nodes.</p>
                            </div>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <h3>● What are different types of Nodes?</h3>
                            <div>
                                <p>The XDC network hosts four different kinds of nodes. Many nodes don't require the functionality of or have the resources to run full nodes. Nodes that only write to the private state of a sub-network don't require all components of the XDC protocol. Furthermore, the ability to run full nodes will also be restricted to institutions that meet the criteria for it.</p>
                            </div>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <h3>● Who can host a Node?</h3>

                                <p>The XDC token is built upon the ERC20 token standard. This design decision was taken to ensure a fundamental compatibility with the multitude of emerging Ethereum Dapps. With a view at future interoperability with the Ethereum Blockchain, the choice of using the ERC20 standard was straightforward. This compatibility extends to smart contracts written for the Ethereum Blockchain. We have developed our own standard XDC01 that will ensure users on the XDC Blockchain do not accidentally send their tokens to an incompatible ERC20 based Blockchain. The XDC01 standard is built on top of the ERC20 standard to ensure future compatibility when interoperability allows for such kinds of transfers.This does not mean that we participate in the ERC20 public Ethereum ecosystem. Our implementation uses the ERC20 standard in our forked hybrid blockchain platform that does not connect to the public Ethereum network.</p>

This makes them unsuitable for any real world mission critical applications. In the long term, a more practical consensus mechanisms will be built on Stake driven consensus. XinFin network is currently designed on PBFT+stake driven consensus which means participating entities such as masternodes and institutions have to stake their tokens. This simply means that in-spite of having 100 Billion tokens, most will be staked and locked for running masternodes, private subnetworks and various financial applications. Also the tokens have release schedule.</p>

                            <h3>● Why XinFin & XDC Protocol?</h3>
                            <div>
                                <p>XinFin (<a href="www.XinFin.org" target="_blank">www.XinFin.org</a>) is a Singapore based Blockchain technology company focused on international trade and finance. XinFin has developed a high scalable, secure, permissioned and commercial grade Blockchain architecture that combines the best features of Bitcoin, Quorum and Ethereum. XinFin's XDC protocol, forked from Ethereum, is a peer to peer contract platform than can be used with existing laws of the land and payment rails or in an approved jurisdiction using underlying XDC tokens.</p>
                                <p>The XDC blockchain is built upon the paradigm of consortium blockchains. The architecture differs from conventional private/permissioned blockchains as well as public blockchains yet built upon the Ethereum codebase. The 'hybrid' nature of the XDC blockchain allows for interoperability with public blockchains like Ethereum and Bitcoin. Transactions that are marked as hybrid on the XDC blockchain can be transmitted to and executed on the Ethereum public blockchain without the need of external wallets or exchanges. The XDC protocol seeks to create a truly decentralized cryptocurrency space through interoperability. The platform maintains sensitive financial data in private state thereby making it enterprise ready for several business use cases.It is this level of interoperability that enables XinFin to run it's own very native XDC01 token as well as its own ERC20 token.</p>

                            <h3>● Why ERC20 along with XDC01?</h3>
                            <div>
                                <p>XinFin tokens are on built on XDC01 protocol which is first of its kind hybrid protocol. While the APIs have been standardized, listing a newer protocol on the exchanges is a time consuming process. This limits the liquidity and a wide number of business use cases cannot be scaled. Liquidity allows tokens to be bought and sold at stable prices on the regulated exchanges. When larger orders are placed, lower liquidity results in a more volatile market and it changes price drastically. In a higher liquidity market, token prices do not fluctuate as widely.It has always part of XinFin's development strategy to connect at least part of the XDC supply directly on the Ethereum public chain through an ERC20 token.To boost liquidity of XDC tokens and support large no. of business use cases, XinFin is introducing an ERC20 token.</p>

                            <div>
                                <p>The development of an ERC20 token also creates a volatile pool of liquidity that will support various business use cases. Another benefit that traders will likely enjoy the most is the price of XDCE. The new ERC20 token will be priced 1:1 against the standard XDC01 token. This means that the price of XDCE will directly reflect the price of XDC at all times.</p>
                                <p>The total supply of XDCE will be 15B with the total supply in circulation and is swappable 1:1 with the 15B of available supply on XDC01 protocol.</p>

                            <div>
                                <p>Proof of Work driven public networks consume huge amount of electricity, have high transaction costs and has huge latency times. This makes them unsuitable for any real world mission critical applications. In the long term, a more practical consensus mechanisms will be built on Stake driven consensus. XinFin network is currently designed on PBFT+stake driven consensus which means participating entities such as masternodes and institutions have to stake their tokens. This simply means that in-spite of having 100 Billion tokens, most will be staked and locked for running masternodes, private subnetworks and various financial applications. Also the tokens have release schedule.</p>
                                <p><b>Founders Pool (25%) -</b> Locked for 1 year and 1% only can be released every year. This ensures that the founders are committed to the project for long term</p>

                            <div>
                                <p>XDCE is an ERC 20 on trustless ethereum public network. The ethereum network does not have provision for KYC at protocol level. Many service providers offering KYC layer for ERC20 tokens operate in the trustless environment and may make misuse of customer data.</p>
                                <p>XinFin is going for a long term 3 phase approach towards making the system KYC/AML compliant :</p>
                                <ul style="list-style-type:decimal;">

                                    <li>A Whitelist KYC/AML distributed and secure network (under development) for all ethereum addresses holding XDCE tokens. This ensures that even exchanges dealing with XDCE token holders can enforce KYC/AML on the addresses before a digital asset exchange can take place.</li>

                                <p>XDC tokens are built on the XDC01 protocol. This is not a standard ERC20 token. Our teams have the published and integrated the APIs by closely working with the exchanges. The same are currently undergoing security and scalability check to ensure safe transactions.

                            <div>
                                <p>Online wallets often seem to be a convenient way of storing cryptocurrency tokens but could actually be very insecure. Certain implementations of online wallets are simply web applications with access to wallets running on a full node. It is extremely insecure to share private and public keys, something that is inevitable with most online wallet implementations. An added concern is the accidental or planned shutting down of the node hosting the wallet. In that case all tokens are lost or stolen. These incidents are not only financially damaging but also hurt the general reputation of the Blockchain ecosystem. 
The XDC ecosystem will provide easily accessible light wallets that will connect securely to full nodes. Each light wallet will have unique keys that are used to sign transactions from their associated account. Since the light wallet is a standalone application that serves only one account, the possibility of being hacked or losing the XDC tokens becomes highly unlikely.</p>

                            <div>
                                <p>One major problem with using the ECR20 standard in designing custom tokens is that transfers from Ethereum wallets will result in a loss of ether. This is a design challenge that a lot of custom coins face. We at XinFin are going to be using specialized functions that call on the token's contract rather than sending them from a wallet, preventing loss of tokens.</p>

                            <div>
                                <p>XinFin.org has opened up its platform for participation for the best programming minds of the world. It believes that a hybrid blockchain protocol like XDC holds a greater chance to going into full production of real world institutions. The XinFin developer community will be integral in the maturation of the XDC protocol. This kind of development will be very beneficial in the long term for production implementations of blockchain technology in regulated financial industries. There are bounties for developers that are able to contribute in meaningful ways that include allocation of XDCs, the native fuel of XDC protocol. We hope to attract the best developer talent, on a project, that we believe, is going to be revolutionary in the mainstreaming of blockchain technology.</p>
