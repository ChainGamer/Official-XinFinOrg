                            <p>XinFin Network is a hybrid trust+trustless network between participants. The network itself operates with randomized consensus between masternodes. With approx 500+ masternodes, the network is fairly decentralized and can work with characteristics of a trustless network.</p>
                            <p>However, XinFin Network is also designed to be a trusted network with its key participants that can participate in Governance as well as compliance of the network.</p>
