        <p class="mb-2">Delegated Proof of Stake (also known as DPoS) is a consensus algorithm used to sustain digital democracy throughout the XinFin Hybrid blockchain network.</p>
        <p>XinFin's Delegated Proof of Stake is a decentralised way of validating transactions occurring on the XinFin Hybrid blockchain and appending those to the truth ledger. Unlike alternative consensus algorithms, XinFin's Delegated Proof of Stake makes use of real-time voting to elect a pool of validators (or delegates). These validators bear responsibilities to preserve the sanctity of the XinFin Hybrid blockchain network.</p>

                            <li> Practical Byzantine Fault tolerant: achieves the same output as Bitcoin and provides distributed/decentralised trust network</li>

                            <li> Block rewards: incentivises masternodes with block rewards. This ensures entities running their applications on XinFin Network as well as validators ensuring the stable public network get rewarded</li>
                            <li> Upcoming Sharding: Will make it really easy to manage chain data for the nodes</li>
