<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Delegated Proof of Stake</strong> (also known as <strong>DPoS</strong>) is a consensus algorithm used to sustain digital democracy throughout the XinFin Hybrid blockchain network. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">XinFin&rsquo;s Delegated Proof of Stake is a decentralized way of validating transactions occurring on the XinFin Hybrid blockchain and appending those to the truth ledger. Unlike alternative consensus algorithms, XinFin&rsquo;s Delegated Proof of Stake makes use of real-time voting to elect a pool of validators (or delegates). </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The network validators bear responsibilities to preserve the sanctity of the XinFin Hybrid blockchain network. The more robust is the nexus of the validators, the more secure is the blockchain.</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Validators are responsible to validate and convert the transactions created by the producers into legitimate blocks.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Validators are responsible for broadcasting these blocks throughout the XinFin Hybrid blockchain network. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Validators must keep their node in sync with the XinFin Hybrid blockchain network at all times.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Validators are responsible for solving any unforeseen issues in the XinFin Hybrid blockchain network in a free and fair democratic manner.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Validators are responsible for keeping the network secure by living up to the above-mentioned expectations.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Let&rsquo;s explore why DPoS proved to be the most sagacious choice for XinFin.</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">XinFin&rsquo;s DPoS proved itself to be truly democratic due to the fact that even a machine with regular configurations can carry oneself as a validator node. The prospect of catering to horizontal scaling by the addition of new nodes is well accommodated by the algorithmic design of XinFin&rsquo;s DPoS.</span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">XinFin&rsquo;s DPoS algorithm passes the &lsquo;environment-friendly&rsquo; test with flying colors. There is absolutely no requirement for high energy for XDC token staking. This is buttressed by the fact that a typical computer can be used to stake XDC tokens. </span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">XinFin Public DPoS Consensus algorithm comes with KYC profiling enforced on the nodes itself solving some substantial problem statements behind Enterprise KYC, thereby driving steady enterprise adoption of XDC Blockchain. The self-kyc feature of Consensus enables corporate customers to create and manage their own identities by uploading all necessary details/documentation and then give permission to the various participants to access the KYC data. This adds more enterprise use cases and regulator friendliness to the XinFin public network. </span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">XinFin&rsquo;s blockchain is agile and alacritous. XinFin&rsquo;s blockchain has recorded transaction speed at 2000 TPS on the public chain and unlimited horizontal scaling and TPS due to multiple private &nbsp;chains running at the same time. Such numbers surely add to the possibility of enhanced user experience which is currently lacking in the ecosystem. </span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Upcoming sharding will bring about several changes in the blockchain ecosystem. For instance, the management of chain-data would become much simpler than ever before. The overall overhead of keeping in sync with the entire blockchain history would be divided and as a result; would reduce manifold.</span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">If a peer node does not wish to participate in the consensus yet stay a part of the network, they can operate as &ldquo;light-nodes&rdquo; or &ldquo;regulatory nodes&rdquo;. These nodes need not hold the entire chain data of the blockchain. XinFin&rsquo;s blockchain has provision for light nodes/regulatory nodes to operate seamlessly.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Specifications:</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> 10 Million XDC staked - Max 5000 validators registration at any time. Stake XDC and setup Masternode. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Future Proofing:</strong> Pooling can be enabled with min 1Mil pooled from each Masternodes Host. At a certain time in the future community consensus can be achieved with 2/3rd vote to have pooled participants host an independent validator. The intention is always to keep the network feasible to operate and incentivising &nbsp;customers equally along with validators</span></p>
