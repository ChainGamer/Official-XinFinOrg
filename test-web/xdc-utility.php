                <h1>XDC/XDCE Utility</h1>
                <p>The XDC token is the underlying utility token of the XinFin hybrid blockchain. The XDC token acts as a settlement mechanism for DApps built on the XinFin hybrid blockchain. XinFin has launched an Ethereum token, XDCE, that can be traded with XDC utility token on a 1:1 ratio. This allows token holder the flexibility to hold tokens in either form for utility. The ERC-20 token can be swapped for the XDC token at a ratio of 1:1. This swap can be made on the AlphaEx exchange which is compatible with all decentralised exchanges and has presence in liquidity markets and supports XDC liquidity. So far, MyContract, TradeFinex, Kramaa, Land Registry, iFactor, XinFin Blockchain Academy, TurantPay are use cases built around XDC Utility.</p>
