                        <p><strong>Change of POW Consensus to DPOS in XDC01 Blockchain</strong></p>
                        <p>Delegated Proof of Stake (DPOS) is the fastest, most efficient, most decentralized, and most flexible consensus model available. DPOS leverages the power of stakeholder approval voting to resolve consensus issues in a fair and democratic way. All network parameters, from fee schedules to block intervals and transaction sizes, can be tuned via elected delegates. Deterministic selection of block producers allows transactions to be confirmed in an average of just 1 second. Perhaps most importantly, the consensus protocol is designed to protect all participants against unwanted regulatory interference.</p>
                        <p>We are now looking for expanding our protocol development to next level with DPOS based Consensus mechanism from POW (Proof of Work) consensus in blockchain.</p>

                        <p><strong>Task 1: DPoS Consensus Developm</strong></p>
                        <p>Too much energy consumption makes PoW consensus non practical and not suitable for real world system. We need to find out other innovative consensus where transaction and network remains de-centralised but without much energy consumption. Restriction numbers of node make its more centralized while large number of nodes makes the system very slow. Many industry experts are trying out different consensus like DPoS. We need to find out innovative solution to replace PoW Consensus with other Consensus which gives more efficiency, speed and less energy consumption. Consensus Related References a. DPOS XDPOS. EOS.

                        <p><strong>Task 2: XDCE Token Staking Function.</strong></p>
                        <p>A staking mechanism requires users who offer compute power or other resources to the service takers in the ecosystem to put up a portion of their tokens in order to do so. If a user has no tokens to stake, but wants to support the network by providing resources they must purchase them. In exchange for staking their tokens and providing the service a financial reward is received. By forcing providers to take a financial risk you are weeding out bad actors.
